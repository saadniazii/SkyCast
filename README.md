# Weather App Project

A Weather App Project made using Async and Await (Asynchronous Code) while applying the knowledge of fetching OpenWeather's API. 

The twelfth project in the Javascript section of The Odin Project.

Spec and details for the assignment can be found [Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)

## Features

* See the Weather App live in the browser.
* The project uses Open Weather API to fetch the data. It is based on a free tier package. 
* This project uses the concept of Asynchronous Code and heavily uses Async and Await to accomplish this.
* The Weather App gives the result of:
    * Description of the weather.
    * Location of the city with country name.
    * Temperature in Celsius.
    * Humidity Levels.
    * Maximum Temperature.
    * and Feels Like temperature.
* Webpack is used to compile the code while following ES6 Modules.

## Possible future additions

None that I can find. Project is completed as it is.

### UI / UX
* The Weather App project is a simplified version of an actual weather app. 
* It contains a search bar and a search button for the user to search for a location.
* Upon clicking the search button, the fetch API keyword will fetch the location entered.
* After the location is fetched, the details of the following are displayed on the page:
    * Description of the weather.
    * Location of the city with country name.
    * Temperature in Celsius.
    * Humidity Levels.
    * Maximum Temperature.
    * and Feels Like temperature.
* Flexbox is used for the majority of the layout.

## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
Learning about Asynchronous Code was a challenge at first. But, like all challenges, it only became easier once I started to put the theory in this project. This project gave me the practice I needed to dig deeper in the concepts of JSON, Asynchronous Code, working with API's and the use of Async and Await.
